## Programs
Contains programs written using the Ocelot [library](https://github.com/umass-compsci220/ocelot-settings/blob/master/src/robotLibrary.ts). These programs serve as NPC agents or other demo programs we may want to share with the students.

## Scripts
Contains scripts to perform CRUD operations on the `ocelot-student-files` bucket exclusively for the custom workshop accounts (_e.g._ `ocelot-1@cs.umass.edu`).

Requires the [`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) CL tool. Additionally, you must have access to the appropriate GCP project.
